# DruMulator

Reads ASCII-style drum tabs and display them in a DrumMania-like interface.

### Q&A

#### Q: How do I hit the notes with my keyboard/MIDI-drum?
A: You don't. It's less than a video game and more of a way to visualize/hear the tabs. Of course I don't hate the idea of making this into a game, it's just not a priority.

#### Q: The sounds aren't very good...
A: That is not a question, but yes, the sounds are not great. If you have better sounds, send me a Pull Request (or open an issue with the sound files attached or something).

#### Q: How do I play my songs on this?
A: Make them into a ASCII-style drum tab (like the one below) and hopefully you'll be able to play it in DruMulator.

```
HH|x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-|
S|----o-------o---|
B|o-------o-------|
```

#### Q: My drum kit has 130 cymbals but the game only shows one, why?
A: For now only these labels get recognized -> "C", "HH", "S", "B", "T", "FT". Yes I have plans to change that.

#### Q: The music won't start with my tab, what's wrong?
A: I don't know. Open an issue with your tab and I'll look into it.

#### Q: That's not how playing drums work at all.
A: I know.
